# Cainam Frontend Cursor Rules

## Overview
These rules are designed to ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to the project's goals and technical constraints for the Cainam Frontend codebase. They are derived from the project's memory bank and should be followed diligently.

## General Guidelines
1. **Client Directive**
   - All interactive components must include `'use client'` at the top of the file to ensure proper client-side rendering.

2. **Styling Pattern**
   - Follow the Shadcn/ui component patterns for consistent styling across the application.
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and CSS variables for theming.

3. **Import Style**
   - Use relative imports for all components to maintain consistency and avoid path issues.

4. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Ensure all components support dark mode using CSS variables and Tailwind CSS.
   - Implement dark mode transitions smoothly to enhance user experience.

5. **Type Safety**
   - Adhere to strict TypeScript mode for type safety and code reliability.
   - Ensure all components and functions are properly typed.

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Implement a mobile-first responsive design approach for all components.
   - Ensure the application is fully functional on both mobile and desktop devices.

7. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Plan for test-driven development, with comprehensive testing to be implemented.
   - Use JSDoc for component documentation to ensure clarity and maintainability.

## Component Architecture
1. **Compound Components**
   - Use compound components for complex UI elements to promote reusability and maintainability.

2. **Custom Hooks**
   - Leverage custom hooks for shared logic and state management across components.

3. **Context Providers**
   - Utilize context providers for global state management, such as theme and authentication.

## Development Workflow
1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow ESLint rules for code quality and use Prettier for consistent formatting.
   - Regularly review and refactor code to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

2. **Version Control**
   - Use Git for version control, following a structured branching strategy.
   - Ensure all changes are properly documented in commit messages.

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Plan for CI/CD pipeline implementation to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Performance and Security
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize components for performance, focusing on load times and responsiveness.
   - Use server components for static content and client components for interactivity.

2. **Security Best Practices**
   - Implement security best practices, including HTTPS, CSP headers, and input sanitization.
   - Regularly review and update security measures to protect user data.

These rules are a living document and should be updated as the project evolves and new insights are gained. They serve as a guide to ensure the Cainam Frontend project is developed and maintained to the highest standards.

# Cursor's Memory Bank

I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)

1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context

Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:

- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Act Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update .cursorrules if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update .cursorrules]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

The .cursorrules file is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with you and the project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone. It should NEVER be longer than 20 lines.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in .cursorrules]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read .cursorrules]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture

- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help me work more effectively with you and the project. Think of .cursorrules as a living document that grows smarter as we work together. IT SHOULD NEVER BE LONGER THAN 20 LINES.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
