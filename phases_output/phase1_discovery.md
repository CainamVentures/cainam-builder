      "findings": "=== Chunk 1 Analysis ===\n# Structure Analysis Report\n\n## Directory Overview\nThis appears to be a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS integration. The project follows a modern Next.js 13+ file-based routing structure.\n\n## Key Directories\n\n### 1. App Directory (`/app`)\n- Main application directory following Next.js App Router convention\n- Contains core layout and page components\n- Organized into feature-specific subdirectories:\n  - `/agents` - With nested `/builder` subdirectory\n  - `/workflows`\n- Includes `globals.css` for global styles\n\n### 2. Library Directory (`/lib`)\n- Contains utility functions in `utils.ts`\n- Serves as a central location for shared code\n\n### 3. Public Assets (`/public`)\n- Contains static assets\n- Has an `images` subdirectory for image resources\n\n## Key Configuration Files\n1. Build/Environment Configuration:\n   - `next.config.mjs`\n   - `next-env.d.ts`\n   - `tailwind.config.ts`\n   - `postcss.config.mjs`\n   - `components.json`\n\n2. Package Management:\n   - `package.json`\n   - `bun.lockb` (indicating use of Bun package manager)\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n1. **Routing Structure**\n   - Uses Next.js file-based routing\n   - Each `page.tsx` represents a route endpoint\n   - Hierarchical organization with nested routes under features\n\n2. **Feature Organization**\n   - Feature-first architecture with dedicated directories for:\n     - Agents functionality\n     - Workflow management\n     - Builder interface\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Consider adding:\n   - A dedicated `components` directory for shared UI components\n   - A `types` or `interfaces` directory for TypeScript definitions\n   - Documentation files (README.md)\n\n2. The current structure is clean but could benefit from:\n   - More granular component organization\n   - Separation of concerns between UI and business logic\n   - Addition of testing directory structure\n\n## Summary\nThe project follows modern Next.js conventions with a clear separation of features. The structure suggests a medium-sized application with focus on agents and workflow functionality. The use of Bun package manager indicates a modern development approach."

      "findings": "=== Chunk 1 Analysis ===\n# Dependency Analysis Report\n\n## Overview\nBased on the project structure, this appears to be a Next.js application using TypeScript, with Tailwind CSS for styling and Bun as the package manager.\n\n## Key Dependencies Identified\n\n### Core Framework Dependencies\n- Next.js (identified by `next.config.mjs` and project structure)\n- TypeScript (identified by `.ts` and `.tsx` files)\n- Bun (identified by `bun.lockb`)\n\n### UI and Styling Dependencies\n- Tailwind CSS (identified by `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.mjs`)\n- PostCSS (identified by `postcss.config.mjs`)\n\n## Version Requirements\n\nWithout access to the package.json contents, I cannot provide specific version requirements. However, based on the project structure, I can recommend:\n\n- Next.js: ^14.0.0 or later (recommended for modern features)\n- TypeScript: ^5.0.0 or later\n- Tailwind CSS: ^3.0.0 or later\n- PostCSS: ^8.0.0 or later\n\n## Compatibility Considerations\n\n1. **Next.js & TypeScript**\n- Ensure TypeScript version is compatible with Next.js version\n- `next-env.d.ts` presence indicates proper TypeScript setup\n\n2. **Bun Compatibility**\n- Bun is relatively new - ensure all dependencies are compatible\n- Some packages might not work with Bun as they do with npm/yarn\n\n3. **Tailwind & PostCSS**\n- Tailwind CSS requires proper PostCSS configuration\n- Verify PostCSS plugins compatibility\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Include explicit version pinning in package.json to prevent unexpected updates\n2. Maintain a comprehensive lockfile (already present as `bun.lockb`)\n3. Consider documenting any specific version requirements in project documentation\n\n## Limitations of Analysis\n- Unable to provide exact version requirements without package.json contents\n- Cannot verify actual dependency compatibility without dependency tree\n- Limited insight into specific package configurations\n\n## Follow-up Actions Needed\n1. Review actual package.json contents for complete dependency analysis\n2. Verify Bun compatibility with all project dependencies\n3. Check for any deprecated dependencies or version conflicts"

      "findings": "=== Chunk 1 Analysis ===\n# Tech Stack Analysis Report\n\n## Identified Technologies & Frameworks\n\n### Core Framework\n- **Next.js**\n  - Latest Version: 14.x\n  - Indicated by: `next.config.mjs`, `next-env.d.ts`\n  - Current Best Practices:\n    - App Router architecture (confirmed by `/app` directory structure)\n    - Server Components by default\n    - TypeScript integration (`.tsx` files)\n\n### Development Environment\n- **Bun**\n  - Indicated by: `bun.lockb`\n  - Latest Version: 1.0+\n  - Best Practices:\n    - Faster package installation\n    - Native TypeScript support\n    - Compatible with Node.js packages\n\n### Styling Technologies\n1. **Tailwind CSS**\n   - Indicated by: `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`\n   - Latest Version: 3.x\n   - Best Practices:\n     - Use JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler\n     - TypeScript configuration\n     - Integration with PostCSS\n\n2. **PostCSS**\n   - Indicated by: `postcss.config.mjs`\n   - Used for CSS processing\n   - Commonly used plugins should be configured\n\n### Type System\n- **TypeScript**\n  - Indicated by: `.tsx` and `.ts` files\n  - Latest Version: 5.x\n  - Best Practices:\n    - Strict mode recommended\n    - Path aliases for clean imports\n    - Type-safe component props\n\n## Project Structure Analysis\n- Modern Next.js App Router structure\n- Organized feature-based architecture:\n  - `/agents` directory suggesting microservices or agent-based architecture\n  - `/workflows` indicating process management features\n  - Separation of concerns with `/lib` utilities\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Ensure all TypeScript configurations are properly set\n2. Configure Tailwind's content paths correctly\n3. Implement proper PostCSS optimization plugins\n4. Consider adding ESLint and Prettier for code quality\n5. Set up proper module path aliases in tsconfig\n\n## Documentation Links\n- Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs\n- Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs\n- TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs\n- Bun: https://bun.sh/docs\n- PostCSS: https://postcss.org/docs/\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided directory structure and configuration files. Additional configuration files would be needed for a more detailed analysis."
