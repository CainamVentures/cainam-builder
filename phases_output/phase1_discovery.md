      "findings": "# Structure Analysis Report\n\n## Project Overview\nThis is a Next.js application focused on an agent-based system, likely for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents. The project follows Next.js's App Router architecture pattern with a component-based UI structure.\n\n## Directory Structure Analysis\n\n### Main Application Structure\n- The project follows Next.js App Router architecture (`app/` directory)\n- Clear separation between application routes and reusable components\n- UI components are organized in a dedicated `components/ui/` directory\n- Configuration files are at the root level\n\n## Key Architectural Components\n\n### 1. Main Application Routes\nThe `app/` directory contains the primary routes of the application:\n- `/agents` - Main agent management interface\n- `/agents/builder` - Agent creation/editing interface\n- `/resources` - Resource management\n- `/scenarios` - Scenario configuration\n- `/settings` - Application settings\n- `/tools` - Tools management\n- `/workflows` - Workflow configuration\n\n### 2. Component Organization\n- **App Components** (`app/components/`):\n  - `AgentBuilder.tsx` - Component for building agents\n  - `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar component\n\n- **Reusable UI Components** (`components/ui/`):\n  - Contains 16 UI components representing a comprehensive design system\n  - Chat-related components (`chat-bubble.tsx`, `chat-input.tsx`, etc.)\n  - Core UI elements (`button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `avatar.tsx`, etc.)\n  - Data visualization components (`chart.tsx`, `chart-demo.tsx`)\n\n### 3. Support Files and Utilities\n- **Hooks** (`hooks/`):\n  - `use-auto-scroll.tsx` - Custom hook for automatic scrolling\n\n- **Utilities** (`lib/`):\n  - `utils.ts` - General utility functions\n\n- **Memory Bank** (`memory-bank/`):\n  - Contains markdown files serving as knowledge/context sources\n  - Includes product context, system patterns, and technical references\n\n### 4. Configuration Files\n- Next.js configuration files (`next.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`)\n- Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts`)\n- PostCSS configuration (`postcss.config.js`, `postcss.config.mjs`)\n- Development container configuration (`devcontainer.json`)\n\n## Relationships and Dependencies\n\n1. **Page-Component Relationship**:\n   - Main route pages likely import components from the `components/` directories\n   - The `AgentBuilder.tsx` component is likely used in the `/agents/builder` route\n\n2. **UI Component System**:\n   - Comprehensive UI component library suggests design system implementation\n   - Chat-specific components indicate chat functionality is central to the application\n\n3. **Knowledge Base Integration**:\n   - The `memory-bank/` directory contains context files likely used by agents\n\n## Architectural Insights\n\n1. **Next.js App Router Implementation**:\n   - Uses file-based routing with `page.tsx` files in route directories\n   - Central `layout.tsx` for shared application layout\n\n2. **Component Hierarchy**:\n   - Two-level component organization (app-specific and reusable UI)\n   - Chat functionality appears to be a core feature\n\n3. **Agent-Centric Design**:\n   - Directory structure reveals focus on agent creation, management, and deployment\n   - Supporting systems for tools, workflows, and scenarios\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Consider adding TypeScript type definitions directory for shared types\n2. Evaluate whether route-specific components should be co-located with their routes\n3. Consider organizing the memory-bank files in a more structured hierarchy if they grow in number\n\nThe project follows modern Next.js architectural patterns and shows a clear separation of concerns between routes, components, and utilities."

      "findings": "# Dependency Agent Report\n\n## Executive Summary\nBased on the provided project structure, this appears to be a Next.js application with React components, utilizing TailwindCSS for styling and potentially a component library like Shadcn UI. While no explicit package.json content was provided, I've analyzed the file structure to identify dependencies and potential compatibility concerns.\n\n## Identified Dependencies\n\n### Core Framework\n- **Next.js**: Identified by `next.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`, and page directory structure\n- **React**: Required by Next.js, used in component files (`.tsx` extensions)\n- **TypeScript**: Identified by `.tsx` and `.ts` file extensions and `next-env.d.ts`\n\n### UI and Styling\n- **TailwindCSS**: Identified by `tailwind.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `postcss.config.js`\n- **PostCSS**: Identified by `postcss.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs`\n- **Shadcn UI**: Likely used based on the UI component structure in `/components/ui/` and `components.json`\n\n### Additional Features\n- **Chart library**: Suggested by `chart.tsx` and `chart-demo.tsx` (possibly Recharts, Chart.js, or similar)\n- **Development container**: Indicated by `devcontainer.json` (likely Docker-based)\n\n## Version Requirements and Compatibility\n\n### Next.js Compatibility\n- **Next.js 13+** or preferably **14+**: Based on the app directory structure, this project uses the App Router introduced in Next.js 13\n- **React 18+**: Required for the latest Next.js features, especially server components\n\n### TypeScript Compatibility\n- **TypeScript 5.0+**: Recommended for compatibility with Next.js 14 and React 18\n- Ensure `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` are aligned with the React version\n\n### TailwindCSS Configuration\n- **TailwindCSS 3.0+**: Required for compatibility with Next.js App Router\n- **PostCSS 8.0+**: Needed for current TailwindCSS\n\n### Development Environment\n- **Node.js 18.17+**: Minimum for Next.js 14 support\n- **npm 9+**, **yarn 1.22+**, or **pnpm 8+**: Any of these package managers would be suitable\n\n## Potential Compatibility Issues\n\n1. **Dual Configuration Files**: The presence of both `.js` and `.mjs`/`.ts` versions of configuration files (next.config, postcss.config, tailwind.config) could lead to confusion about which is being used. Recommend standardizing on one format.\n\n2. **App Router Migration**: If this project was migrated from Pages Router to App Router, there might be lingering compatibility issues with routing or data fetching patterns.\n\n3. **TypeScript and React Type Definitions**: Ensure TypeScript versions and React type definitions are compatible to avoid type errors.\n\n4. **Chart Library Compatibility**: Chart libraries may have specific peer dependency requirements for React versions.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Dependency Documentation**: Create a comprehensive document listing all dependencies with their version requirements.\n\n2. **Version Pinning**: Pin critical dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected breaks from minor updates.\n\n3. **Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` or equivalent to identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies.\n\n4. **Configuration Standardization**: Standardize configuration file formats (either .js, .mjs, or .ts) to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Package Upgrade Strategy**: Implement a regular dependency update schedule with proper testing to ensure continued compatibility.\n\n6. **Peer Dependency Check**: Verify that all packages with peer dependency requirements have compatible versions installed.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Analyze the full `package.json` content to verify exact dependency versions\n2. Run dependency analysis tools like `npm-check` or `depcheck` to identify unused or outdated dependencies\n3. Implement automated dependency update workflows with appropriate testing\n\nThis report was compiled based on file structure analysis. A more detailed assessment would require examining the actual content of `package.json` and code files."
