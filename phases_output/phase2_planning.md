# Phase 2: Methodical Planning (o1)

Below is a step-by-step plan for analyzing the project structure and its components, drawing upon the findings from the Structure, Dependency, and Tech Stack Agents. This plan is designed to help you systematically review each file, determine critical areas for deeper investigation, establish documentation guidelines, and develop a strategy for mapping inter-dependencies.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. FILE-BY-FILE EXAMINATION APPROACH
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.1 Organize Files by Folders/Roles
   • Group files based on their folder (e.g., /app, /components, /hooks, /lib, /memory-bank, and config files).  
   • Within each folder, sort files by functionality (e.g., UI components, application logic, hooks, utilities).

1.2 Establish an Examination Checklist
   For each file, document:
   1) Purpose and functionality: What is this file's primary role (UI, routing, configuration, etc.)?  
   2) Dependencies: Which imports are used? Which other parts of the application are referenced?  
   3) Key exports: Which classes, functions, or components are exported?  
   4) Known issues or complexities: Any specialized logic or advanced patterns?

1.3 Start With the Root-Level and Configuration Files
   • Examine next.config.js / next.config.mjs:
     ◦ Identify any custom Next.js configuration (rewrites, redirects, experimental features).  
   • Tailwind/PostCSS configuration files:
     ◦ Confirm how Tailwind CSS is extended or customized.  
   • devcontainer.json:
     ◦ Verify the development environment setup and dependencies needed for container-based development.  

1.4 Move on to the “App” Directory
   • For each route folder in /app:
     ◦ page.tsx: Identify the page’s main content and how it uses shared or route-specific components.  
     ◦ layout.tsx: Check global layout and see what components (e.g., headers, sidebars) are consistently used.  
     ◦ Sub-routes (e.g., /agents/builder):
       - Understand how specialized components (e.g., AgentBuilder) integrate with main application logic.  

1.5 Examine Components in /components and /components/ui
   • “App Components” (/app/components):
     ◦ Understand bridging logic between UI and route-specific functionality (e.g., AgentBuilder, Sidebar).  
   • “UI Components” (/components/ui):
     ◦ Verify styling, usage of Tailwind classes, and reusability patterns.  
     ◦ Focus on the chat components first if chat functionality is central to the application (chat-bubble, chat-input, etc.).  

1.6 Review Utility and Hook Files
   • /hooks (e.g., use-auto-scroll.tsx):
     ◦ Understand the context where the hook is used, focusing on any state management or side-effects.  
   • /lib (e.g., utils.ts):
     ◦ Identify utility functions and any possible duplication or overlap with other utilities.  

1.7 Inspect the Memory Bank
   • /memory-bank:
     ◦ Confirm the structure and organization of Markdown files providing agent knowledge or references.  
     ◦ Check how these files are consumed in the application (direct import, dynamic load, or other patterns).  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. CRITICAL AREAS NEEDING INVESTIGATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.1 Next.js App Router Usage
   • Verify correct file-based routing structure and usage of Server Components vs. Client Components.  
   • Ensure there are no remnants of the older Pages Router that might cause confusion.

2.2 Custom Configuration Files
   • Validate consistency in how configuration settings (next.config.js/mjs, tailwind.config.js/ts, postcss.config.js/mjs) are managed.  
   • Ensure there is a single source of truth, reducing the risk of conflicting configs.

2.3 Agent-Related Directories
   • /app/agents, /tools, /workflows, /scenarios:  
     ◦ These directories likely contain critical business logic for the agent system and workflows.  
     ◦ Investigate how these routes interact with each other or share common components/logic.

2.4 UI Consistency and Design System
   • Confirm if the Shadcn UI components in /components/ui have been customized or used consistently.  
   • Check for any UI design discrepancies or partial migration to the design system.

2.5 Dependency Alignment and Version Issues
   • Look for unused or outdated dependencies in package.json (once that file is reviewed).  
   • Confirm that peer dependencies (e.g., React, Next.js, chart libraries) match the required versions.

2.6 Cross-Cutting Concerns
   • Data fetching patterns (e.g., whether using the new Next.js 13+ react-fetch or older methods).  
   • Global state management (if any), focusing on the agent interactions and chat functionality.  
   • Potential security or performance bottlenecks (e.g., chat interactions or memory bank usage).

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.1 File-Level Documentation
   • For each important component or utility, provide JSDoc or TSDoc comments describing:  
     ◦ Input props/types.  
     ◦ Return values or rendered UI.  
     ◦ Any side effects or external dependencies.

3.2 Architecture & High-Level Overviews
   • Maintain a “Project Architecture” document outlining:  
     ◦ The Next.js App Router organization.  
     ◦ Key directories (agents, tools, workflows, etc.) and their role.  
     ◦ The flow of data (particularly for agent-based logic or scenario management).

3.3 Configuration Documentation
   • Provide an overview of how each configuration file (Tailwind, PostCSS, Next.js) is structured and what it does.  
   • Include environment-specific settings if the project differentiates between dev, staging, and production.

3.4 Dependency Tracking
   • List all major libraries (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, chart libraries) with version constraints.  
   • Document rationale for any pinned versions or specific package versions.

3.5 Agent & Workflow Documentation
   • Since the project is agent-centric, document how agents are defined, created, and updated.  
   • Provide usage examples or a quick start guide for building or modifying workflows.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. INTER-DEPENDENCY MAPPING METHOD
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.1 Dependency Graph Generation
   • Use tooling (e.g., “depcheck,” “madge,” or “npx ts-prune”) to generate a graph of imports and exports.  
   • Visualize which files or components are heavily depended upon to identify single points of failure or high-complexity areas.

4.2 Cross-Referencing Configurations
   • Map each route or component to the relevant config files they depend on (e.g., environment variables from next.config.js).  
   • Ensure consistent naming conventions and paths across distinct configs (tailwind.config, postcss, etc.).

4.3 Linking UI Components to Data Models
   • Identify which UI components (like the chat components) depend on which data models or hooks.  
   • Note references in a central “UI to Data” reference table, clarifying how data flows from routes to UI.

4.4 Agent & Workflow Integration
   • Document how the /agents directory integrates with /tools, /workflows, and /scenarios.  
   • Note any shared logic or shared data:  
     ◦ Agents might use the same tool or scenario.  
     ◦ Tools might feed data into multiple workflows.

4.5 Ongoing Maintenance Approach
   • Propose an automated check in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions or similar) that updates or verifies the dependency graph.  
   • Keep the dependency map up to date every time a new feature or library is introduced.

CONCLUSION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Following this plan will allow for a thorough review of the project, ensuring that both high-level architecture and low-level file details are properly understood and documented. By systematically examining each file, focusing on critical areas like the agent directories and configuration files, and mapping out component and library dependencies, you will be equipped to maintain, evolve, and secure this Next.js agent-based system effectively.
